    "\n",
    "The microscope image of the parasite is defined as a contiguous blob but still an arbitrary shape, the best after-data structure that I could come up with after much research is Run Length Encoding. </br>\n",
    "Given a string such as MIIICCCRROO - can be represented as M1I3C3R2O2 when we apply RLE, which is basically we keep track of repeated continuous elements followed by length it occupies. In our case as we have continuous representation and that two just two values 0(background) and 1(parasite), It makes the storage of such a large image highly memory efficient. Now let's look at the Best and Worst Time complexity.</br>\n",
    "Best Case : </br>\n",
    "Assuming the best case as a more realistically contiguous area rather than a perfect square, with 2 entries per row for 100,000 rows:\n",
    "8 bytes * 2 entries/row * 100,000 rows = 1,600,000 bytes or approximately 1.53 MB. </br>\n",
    "Worst Case : </br>\n",
    "If we estimate, for example, that the parasite winds through each row of the image, it could potentially double the entries needed,  there will be 100,000 elements in the RLE data - </br>\n",
    "8 bytes * 4 entries/row * 100,000 rows = 3,200,000 bytes or approximately 3.05 MB. This is still an efficient representation given the image's size 100000x100000.\n"

    "To simulate how a parasite spreads, I initially tried allowing it to move in all directions from a starting point. But this method took too much computer power. So, I changed the approach to make the parasite take bigger steps in any direction, picking which way to go randomly. However, this was still too demanding on the computer. To simplify, I decided the parasite pixels should only move in two directions (left or right) and switch between these after moving a good distance. After being done with a row, I return RLE encoding for that row(start,end). This would still generate a realistic parasite image and which is contonous. To figure out how far it should go in a direction, I used the total area the parasite needs to cover and divided it by the number of rows from where the parasite starts to where it ends. This meant setting a minimum length for each part of its path, starting and ending these parts randomly (start at top half and end at bottom half) but within a framework that allowed for direction changes after significant progress. This method made the simulation much easier for the computer to handle, effectively showing how the parasite would spread."

Summing up these intersection points across all rows gave me the total area covered by dye within the parasite.
